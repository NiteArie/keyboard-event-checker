## General Info

Have you ever thought about what it means that the computer you are using is a digital device? Among other things it means that everything its capable of is achieved by translating a digital signal into a sequence of binary digits - 0's and 1's. These binary digits form codes used to represent data.

The keyboard you used to retrieve this project description is a great example of this. Pressing a key generates a digital signal that is translated by the computer into a code representing the key that was pressed.

The goal of the Key Value app is to display the encoded value on screen each time a key is pressed on the keyboard.
